## Overview

gleasonCalc is a package to evaluate systemic functional valeur from a system network (see Figuredo & Figueredo, 2019). It gets agnation, delicacy and valeur magnitudes in data frames in order to visualize, correlate and sort systemic options. 

## Installation

gleasonCalc is still under development. You can install development version of gleasonCalc from GitHub:

```{r}
# Install development version from GitHub:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bmmedinac/gleasonCalc")

```

## Usage

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
