# gleasonCalc
This packages compute the v value (i.e. systemic value) from a (sub)system in a systemic functional network

## Overview

gleasonCalc is a package to evaluate systemic functional valeur from a system network (see Figuredo & Figueredo, 2019). It gets agnation, delicacy and valeur magnitudes in data frames in order to visualize, correlate and sort systemic options in a gleason scale. 

## Installation

gleasonCalc is still under development. You can install development version of gleasonCalc from GitHub:

```
# Install development version from GitHub:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bmmedinac/gleasonCalc")

```

## Usage

As a systemic-functional-linguistics-oriented package, gleasonCalc requires the transformation of a systemic network into a special format in a spreedsheet. 


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
